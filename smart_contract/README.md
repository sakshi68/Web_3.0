This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

run some of the following tasks:


```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat clean
```
